Passionate and focused on the technology market, studying the best ways to solve web-related problems. As a programmer, still discovering a new world and as a person always interested in helping other people achieve their goals, giving them an opportunity.

I love working on open source projects and later migrating to the Big Data area.

I'm a <strong>FullStack</strong> Javascript developer...
